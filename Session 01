 The party woke up bound by heavy chains surrounded by two frog people and a lizardman.
After denying knowing how to get into the city in the sky(?) the frog people and the lizardman left the room,
whereafter a halfling(?) freed the party from their shackles, under the promise of them getting the halfling to Haven(?).

 The party followed the halfling(?) to the other prisoners to let them free,
however shortly after a Giant Hyena broke its shackles and attacked the party,
during the attack a group of three lizardmen came into the room and attacked as well.

 After surviving the attack from both the lizardmen and the hyena, the party and the rest of the prisoners went into the armory,
in there they found weapons and a bit of armor. A box triggered an alarm and the party left the armory immediately,
they were greeted [read: attacked] by a group of fishmen(?) and frog people shortly after,
which resulted in the death of most of the prisoners and the retreat of one, whom later died. 

 After triggering a hidden mechanic the party proceeded into the hall of justice(?),
where they found a group of frog people as well as a giant skull.

 One by one the frog people fell, and the party seemed to have won the battle,
however a tied up frog person fled to a lever and pushed it, activating a fountain of lava.
The lava slowly spread, and touched the skull setting fire to it, which made the skull seemingly come to life.
The skull started speaking and turned out to be a witch(?), and traded insults with one party member,
but ending up getting mad and made the lava come out faster.

 So the party ran away, like a bunch of cowards.
